## Getting there

From Changi Ferry Terminal we boarded a small dinky boat which took about 20 minutes. It was really cheap, costing SG $3 per person, one way.

## Once you're there

Hire a bike to see the island. As soon as you walk into "town" there's no shortage of people trying to get you to hire one. There's wild boars, monkeys and coastal bridge walks.
