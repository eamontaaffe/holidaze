## Getting there

From Colombo Fort Railway Station we took the 6am train to Habarana (the only other train is an overnighter). We weren't organised enough to get reserved tickets (showing up a couple of days earlier didn't work) so we were told to buy them on the day. 3rd class cost us approx 480 LKR.
