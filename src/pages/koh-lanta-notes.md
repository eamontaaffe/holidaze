## Getting there

From Koh Lipe we took a speed boat to get to the pier at Koh Lanta. Took about 3 hours. Once we arrived the taxi drivers hustled us hard and we probably paid twice what we needed to.

## [Klong Khong Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/@7.5712447,99.02995,16z)

Similar to Koh Lipe, Klong Khong beach feels very laid back. The restaurants, bars and massage parlours are a bit more spread out so it doesn't feel like it's packed with tourists. The beach is quite rocky, sprinkled with camouflaged sea cucumbers hidden under the water. During the night, there's plenty of bars and 'shroom bars to choose from.

## [Koh Rok](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Koh+Rok+Yai+Beach/@7.2170081,99.0480757,14z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x304e70fd745241cb:0x37ae8d50f546a661!8m2!3d7.2170028!4d99.0655905)

We took a snorkelling tour to Koh Rok and Koh Ha via speedboat. Both islands are 'virgin' islands, untouched with resorts and closed in low season for maintainance. Koh Rok has the softest sand I've ever stood on and crystal clear water. We stopped a couple of times around the island to snorkel and spotted some pretty big creatures. One of the best beaches yet.

## [Koh Ha](https://www.google.co.th/search?q=koh%20ha&oq=koh+ha&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j0l2.806j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&tbm=lcl&rldimm=5010437758996505122&ved=0ahUKEwjfsqHr2vrYAhWMuI8KHTpVCZsQvS4ILDAA&rldoc=1&tbs=lrf:!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:1#rldoc=1&rlfi=hd:;si:,8.082288325644877,98.5759598769531;mv:!1m3!1d807768.9209412555!2d99.529674!3d8.425833350000001!3m2!1i973!2i614!4f13.1)

Pretty to look at, better to snorkel at. This island is tiny and when we reached it, it was at high tide so there wasn't much of a beach to see. Can't say it was better than Koh Rok but definitely worth seeing.
