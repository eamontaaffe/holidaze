## Notes

## [Pattaya Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Pattaya+Beach/@12.9360693,100.8800315,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31029605af36b5dd:0x4aff93f8a30460a8!8m2!3d12.9360693!4d100.8822202)

Filled with tiki bars all along coast, this beach is best for its nightlife. It has a much more laidback vibe so don't expect a party scene. It's also the closest to Walking Street, which is the main tourist-y street on the island where most restaurants and shops can be found.

## [Sunrise Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sunrise+Beach+Restaurant/@6.4897488,99.3075083,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304c04cda811b283:0xec4a6ea18cddeb3d!8m2!3d6.4897488!4d99.309697)

The island is tiny so it's not hard to get to any of the beaches. This one however is the best beach on the island. With coral so close to the beach, it's not hard to find a good place to snorkel. There's a few bars and restaurants along the beach but it's mostly resorts that want beach views.

## [Sunset Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sunset+Beach/@6.4923332,99.2982829,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304c04b56eb78629:0xe2b542baead9f14a!8m2!3d6.4923332!4d99.3004716)

A teeny tiny beach with not a lot going on.
