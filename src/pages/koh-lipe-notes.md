## Getting there

From Langkawi, we took a ferry from Telaga Terminal (they also took our passports as we boarded but that's a different story...) The ferry took around an hour and a half and was pretty smooth. To get to the coastline we had to jump onto a little wooden Thai boat which took us to Pattaya beach for "immigration".

## [Pattaya Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Pattaya+Beach/@12.9360693,100.8800315,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31029605af36b5dd:0x4aff93f8a30460a8!8m2!3d12.9360693!4d100.8822202)

Best for its nightlife, filled with tiki bars all along the coast. It's also the closest to Walking Street, which is the main tourist-y street on the island with all the restaurants and shops.

## [Sunrise Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sunrise+Beach+Restaurant/@6.4897488,99.3075083,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304c04cda811b283:0xec4a6ea18cddeb3d!8m2!3d6.4897488!4d99.309697)

Best beach on the island and only a few metres from town. Coral is right next to the coastline with lots of good snorkles, especially in the arvo at low tide. There's a few bars and restaurants but it's mostly resorts.

## [Sunset Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sunset+Beach/@6.4923332,99.2982829,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304c04b56eb78629:0xe2b542baead9f14a!8m2!3d6.4923332!4d99.3004716)

It's not the easiest to get to and there isn't a lot going on. But it's also not very busy, so worth a snorkel.
