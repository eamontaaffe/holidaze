## Getting there

From Langkawi, we took a ferry from Telaga Terminal. Probably took an hour and a half and was pretty smooth. We departed from the ferry to get on a wooden Thai boat to take us to Pattaya beach for immigration. As we boarded they also took our passports but that's a different story...

## [Pattaya Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Pattaya+Beach/@12.9360693,100.8800315,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31029605af36b5dd:0x4aff93f8a30460a8!8m2!3d12.9360693!4d100.8822202)

Filled with tiki bars all along coast, this beach is best for its nightlife. It has a much more laidback vibe so don't expect a party scene. It's also the closest to Walking Street, which is the main tourist-y street on the island where most restaurants and shops can be found.

## [Sunrise Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sunrise+Beach+Restaurant/@6.4897488,99.3075083,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304c04cda811b283:0xec4a6ea18cddeb3d!8m2!3d6.4897488!4d99.309697)

The island is tiny so it's not hard to get to any of the beaches. This one however is the best beach on the island. With coral so close to the beach, it's not hard to find a good place to snorkel. It's especially good in the arvo at low tide. There's a few bars and restaurants along the beach but it's mostly resorts with coastal views.

## [Sunset Beach](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sunset+Beach/@6.4923332,99.2982829,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304c04b56eb78629:0xe2b542baead9f14a!8m2!3d6.4923332!4d99.3004716)

It's not the easiest to get to and there isn't a lot going on. But it's also not very busy, so worth a snorkel.
