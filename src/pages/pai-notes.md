Similar to Koh Lipe, Pai thrives on tourism. Its main street (Walking Street) is pretty much the town's city centre with its cafes, bars and markets (this street also turns into a night market after 6pm). However unlike Koh Lipe, Pai is surrounded by mountainous landscapes. There's a lot sightseeing attractions on the outskirts of the town such as hotsprings, waterfalls and viewpoints overlooking the mountains. Scooters are the easiest and cheapest way to get around with most attractions only 30 to 40 mins away. Otherwise there are taxis via booked tours.

## Getting there

Pai is 3 hours from Chiang Mai via minibus (which is the most common form of transport getting there). It was around 200 baht pp. As we learnt, it's probably best to travel in the morning. We took the 4pm bus from Pai and roasted in the bus. Our driver was also a bit of a maniac, fanging down the winding rooms.

## [Conserve Natural Forests](http://conservenaturalforests.org/)

People who truly want to do good in Thailand, focussing on reforestation and animal rehabilitation (including elephants). A one time only 1,000 baht donation, future visits are free.

Probably didn't go during the right season as it was more of a trickle than a waterfall. Sits in the shade so the water is ice cold, but it's meant to be deep so you can jump off the rocks.

For only 20 baht it's definitely worth the visit. The deep fried donuts with condensed milk are also worth it.

Not the warmest spot to go for a swim, but it's a nice spot to hang out for a few hours.

## Tip

There's a lot of hotsprings and waterfalls to visit. Do some research beforehand. Don't get sucked into paying expensive entry fees.
