Somewhere between a shao long bao and a fried dumpling. Soupy on the inside, crispy on the bottom. A standing room only, dumpling express meal. Also serving a special truffle version of these.

 ## [Mido Cafe](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Mido+Cafe/@22.310236,114.1681073,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x340400c036067ce3:0x89c6bcc49deead24!8m2!3d22.310236!4d114.170296)

A picturesque cafe that could set the scene for a movie. Serving Hong Kong style French toast and other Western and Chinese dishes. The hot milk tea and hot coffee is not worth ordering.

## [Lin Heung Tea House](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Lin+Heung+Tea+House/@22.2842663,114.1512579,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3404007c851b53d9:0x39e9975d2b15ea46!8m2!3d22.2842663!4d114.1534466)

Calm by night, hectic by day. Be prepared to fight for your food during Dim Sum (available until 4pm). Find a seat wherever possible on the shared tables, order some tea and take your piece of paper to the closest dim sum trolley. Choose a dish and hand the paper to the trolley lady to stamp. If anything, grab the sticky rice.

## [Potato Head](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Potato+Head+Singapore/@1.280409,103.8395254,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da197263cd0299:0xad77e0cd9ff03662!8m2!3d1.280409!4d103.8417141)

Trendy, expensive but really, really good Indonesian food. Bookings available at Kaum (the restaurant within Potato Head) which has the most amazing roast pig dish. Would trust that everything on the menu is really good.

## [Yardbird](https://www.google.com.au/maps?q=Yardbird&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidnM_nnrbYAhXCrY8KHTTABI4Q_AUICygC)

All of the chicken, yakitori-style with different marinades. The neck was the fave of the night. Also serves larger dishes including KFC (Korean fried cauliflower). They don’t take bookings but the new venue means a short waiting time for a table. 
<span class="date">Location: HK Island</span>
<br></br>

## [Wong Chi Kei](https://www.google.com.au/maps?q=Wong+Chi+Kei&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0t6vfnrbYAhUK148KHeqvBHMQ_AUICigB)

Cheap (!!) and cheerful. Best known for its wonton noodle soup but everything tastes good. Especially the deep fried wontons.
<span class="date">Location: Macau</span>
<br></br>

## [Mak’s Noodles](https://www.google.com.sg/maps/search/Mak%E2%80%99s+Noodles/@11.6498884,99.9500398,5z/data=!3m1!4b1)

Another cheap and cheerful noodle shop with good beef brisket noodles. However one dish per person probably won’t be enough.

## [Kau Kee](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kau+Kee+Restaurant/@22.2842291,114.1503242,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sKau+Kee!3m4!1s0x3404007c7c7a6fb7:0xf2b13f15a9798ac5!8m2!3d22.2842196!4d114.1525103)

Serves beef brisket noodles. Never got to go to this one because of the long queues but by the size of the lines, it must be worth it for the wait.
<span class="date">Location: HK Island</span>
<br></br>

## [Kubrick Bookshop + Cafe](https://www.google.com.au/maps?q=Kubrick+Bookshop+%2B+Cafe&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLwJfLnrbYAhVMq48KHR70DbQQ_AUICygC)

A trendy bookshop alongside a cafe with Japanese vibes. Books and magazines found in English, Japanese or Chinese. 
<span class="date">Location: Kowloon</span>
<br></br>

## [Ozone, Ritz-Carlton](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/The+Ritz-Carlton,+Millenia+Singapore/@1.2905269,103.8600616,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xae7253405fc5cf5f?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG2Pe5nrbYAhXLMo8KHbz-AokQ_BIIpAEwFg)

Top views overlooking the city. If you’re there 'til 8pm you can watch the Pulse Light Show from above. Drinks are expensive (would imagine food is more expensive...) but the popcorn is free.
<span class="date">Location: HK Island</span>

## [Ho Lee Fook](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Ho+Lee+Fook/@22.2829886,114.1503163,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3404007b9ca2027b:0x64470d09bc46ad83!8m2!3d22.2829886!4d114.152505)

This one's been on the list for a while. Like all trending places, this one doesn't take bookings for groups under six people. But the food (Chinese fusion) is meant to be outstanding. 
<span class="date">Location: HK Island</span>

## [Disneyland](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Hong+Kong+Disneyland/@22.3129666,114.0412819,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x35b3af6ce4475405?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqvq757bvYAhVMv48KHb_kAAcQ_BIIowEwEg)

It's not the biggest or the best Disneyland in the world, but it's still a lot of fun. All rides are pretty entertaining even if they aren't fast or scary. Hyperspace Mountain p.k.a Space Mountain is a Star Wars themed rollercoaster is pretty tame but it's still one of the best and has fast pass tickets to skip the queue. 
<span class="date">Location: Lantau Island</span>
