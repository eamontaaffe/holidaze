## Getting around

Uber, uber, uber. Although Grab is pretty popular.
<br></br>

## [Jawi House Cafe Gallery](https://www.google.co.th/maps?q=jawi+house+cafe+penang&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWiNSw9fDYAhVCvY8KHYFFCMcQ_AUICygC2)

Certainly not the cheapest (there's some really really cheap eats here) but certainly good enough to write about. The mutton briyani is so good. The ice milk tea however is not.
<br></br>

## [Sri Ananda](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Sri+Ananda+Bahwan/@5.4174303,100.338243,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304ac38fb1de0d71:0x6505e7dcbe2761d6!8m2!3d5.4174303!4d100.3404317)

There's a couple around Penang. We went to the one in Georgetown (not the vego one 'cos we like meat). Such good Indian food. The menu is endless.
<br></br>

## [Kek Lok Si Temple](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Kek+Lok+Si+Temple,+11500+Ayer+Itam,+Pulau+Pinang,+Malaysia/@5.3995529,100.2717123,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304ac21a8adace3d:0xf577f6f1f5f767a!8m2!3d5.3994269!4d100.2737713)

Only a 20 minute uber drive away from Georgetown, it's definitely worth the visit. A big site with lots of temples, buddhas and monks. Lots to see. There's also the famous assam laksa down the street. Anthony Bourdain approved, which means it must be good.
<br></br>

## [Cheong Fat Tze Mansion aka Blue Mansion](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Cheong+Fatt+Tze+-+The+Blue+Mansion+(Guided+Tours)/@5.421288,100.3330443,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304ac39a68f413c5:0x98884bb078f41ebd!8m2!3d5.421288!4d100.335233)

A historical building renovated to become part museum, part boutique hotel and part restaurant. Pretty sure the only way in is to go on a guided tour if you're not staying there. It's a beautiful building with an interesting history.
<br></br>


## [Red Garden Cafe](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Red+Garden+Cafe/@5.4211922,100.3323291,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304ac39a7332981f:0x6a2e28eeaefd4e2c!8m2!3d5.4211922!4d100.3345178)

A hawker style food court with really cheap eats. Also comes with table service and free entertainment.
